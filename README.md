# Shuffle an array into a random order

I heard about Fisher-Yates shuffle yesterday
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle; also known
as Knuth shuffle, despite the computerized version having been invented
by Richard Durstenfeld). I wrote this as a test to check if I can still
write the algorithm correctly, and secondly to see how the randomness of
shuffling algorithms could be tested.
